# Ghetto CW keyer

CW keyer I made from whatever I had lying around.

I use it with both a paddle and a straight key.

I plug it into an USB audio interface, control the gain there. It has no volume knob.

I use it for training, with this [awesome decoder](https://shingiru.github.io/hangul_cw_decoder.html).
